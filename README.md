This is an application created to be accessible and friendly to people of all genders, identities, interests, and so much more! The possibilities are endless, find new friends, find new dates, fullfil your heart's desire!

## Cloning & Setup

### Frontend Setup

-Fork and clone this repository & run ```git clone <github-repo-code>``` from your terminal

-```cd``` into the directory (I recommend setting up a folder to house both the front and backend and clone both repositories there)

-run ```npm install

-run ```npm start or yarn start to get the browser running

-after cloning the frontend to your computer, set up the backend here: https://github.com/KeslieBox/where_is_me_backend

### Backend Setup

-Fork and clone this repository & run ```git clone <github-repo-code>``` from your terminal

-run ```bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development```

-run ```bundle install```

-run ```rails s``` in the terminal to start your server

-Finally go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser

From here, you can begin using the application and playing around with the database, adding to it, editing what is there to your liking, etc!

Thanks for trying out the app, enjoy!
